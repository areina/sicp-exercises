* Exercise 1.4.
Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

;; If b is a positive value plus it and a, and if it is a negative value, subtract b from a, doing a absolute sum.
